# Ralph Progress Log
Feature: AI Financial Discovery & Alternative Investments
Started: 2026-01-21 21:40 PST

## Codebase Patterns
- React 18 with Vite, Tailwind CSS
- Components use memo() for optimization
- CSS colors defined in src/utils/colors.js (CSS_COLORS, HEX_COLORS)
- Form state managed with useState in InputForm.jsx
- Backend is FastAPI with Pydantic models in web/backend/models.py
- Simulation logic in web/backend/routes/simulate.py
- Financial calculations in web/backend/services/financial_calcs.py
- Claude AI integration in web/backend/services/claude.py
- Collapsible sections use the Section component pattern in InputForm.jsx
- Backend runs on port 8000, frontend on port 1794

## Existing Infrastructure
- Social Security, Healthcare, Pension models already in models.py
- AlternativeInvestment model already defined (needs wiring)
- Financial calc service has SS benefit calculation, RMD, withdrawal sequencing
- AI analysis endpoint exists at /api/analyze

## Iteration - 2026-01-21 22:00 PST
**Story:** US-001 - Create Alternative Investments Backend Models
**Status:** Completed

**What was implemented:**
- Wired alternative investments into the Monte Carlo simulation
- Alternative investment values are now summed and added to initial portfolio value
- Verified all acceptance criteria pass:
  - AlternativeInvestment model already existed with all required fields
  - UserProfile already accepted alternative_investments array
  - Added code to sum alternative investment values into initial_savings
  - Backend starts without errors
  - POST /api/simulate returns 200 with alternative investments (verified: 200k savings + 150k real_estate + 50k crypto = 400k initial portfolio)

**Files changed:**
- web/backend/routes/simulate.py (added AlternativeInvestment import, added alternative investments to initial portfolio value)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The AlternativeInvestment model was already fully defined, just needed wiring
- The simulation uses initial_savings as the starting point - alternative investments add to this
- Test with curl to verify API responses
